# Shell
- This project involves building a simplified shell program in C, referred to as "Pioneer Shell" or "pish." The project focuses on key systems programming concepts such as string manipulation, file I/O, command-line argument parsing, process management using `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()`, and general terminal usage.
    
    The shell operates in two modes: **interactive mode** and **batch mode**. In interactive mode, the shell waits for user input, parses the command into arguments, and either executes built-in commands or spawns a child process to run external programs. Batch mode processes commands from a script file sequentially.
